=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.
=== However, when asked to fill "a table" make each table raw a single line.


=== Q What's the purpose of leaving virtual memory region
===   0xeebfe000-0xeebff000 inaccessible?
===   (free form, up to 10 words)
guard against exception stack overflow with page fault
=== Q Define a page table entry with the following properties:
===   frame starts at 0x1234000. It can be written by the kernel
===   without causing any errors, but has never been written yet. On
===   the other hand, application cannot write to the page, but has
===   recently successfully read from it. All bits which are not
===   responsible for above properties are set to zero.  
===   (a single memory WORD as would be output by gdb's x/1x)
0x01234025
=== Q Consider JOS kernel code:
===     mystery_t x;
===   	char* value = return_a_pointer();
===   	*value = 10;
===   	x = (mystery_t) value;
===   What type mystery_t should refer to?
===   (remove leading "====" from the correct answer line)
uintptr_t
==== physaddr_t


=== Q What information is stored in page directory when mem_init()
===   finishes? For each non-empty PD entry specify:
===    - decimal index (0-1023)
===    - hexadecimal address of virtual memory mapped by this entry
===    - name of kernel data structure which is intended to be
===      accessible through this PDE (when appropriate, in quotes)
===    - general name (free form, up to 10 words in quotes)
===    Sort the table by the index in ascending order. If several
===    consequent entries are only differ in address field, you can
===    specify ellipses ("...") instead of an "inner" entries. Please
===    align columns into readable table using spaces.
===    Format example (all the values are made up; omit the header):
===    INDEX ADDRESS DATA-STRUCTURE         NAME/DESCRIPTION
===    24    0x12345 "struct Segdesc gdt[]" "Global descriptor table"
===    ...
===    42    0x98765 "struct Segdesc gdt[]" "Global descriptor table"

=== Q We have placed the kernel and user environment in the same
===   address space. Why will user programs not be able to read or
===   write the kernel's memory? What specific mechanisms protect the
===   kernel memory?
===   (free form, up to 15 words)
accesing PTE with U flag disable allowed when CPL field in CS is not 0b11
=== Q Which virtual addresses are readable by the user?
===   (in the form ADDR1-ADDR2, if none, specify NONE)
0xef000000-0xef800000
=== Q Which virtual addresses are writable by the user?
===   (in the form ADDR1-ADDR2, if none, specify NONE)
NONE
=== Q Assume a hacker can change N bits inside page table (on any
===   level, PD or PT) after it has been set up by the kernel (and
===   before full TLB flush). What is the minimal N to gain full
===   control of the system from hacker's user space process?
1
=== Q What's the maximum amount of physical memory this kernel can
===   support? (number of megabytes, without MB suffix)
256
=== Q What single constant can be changed in kernel source to make
===   this limit 2 times lower (if kernel normally supports 10MB,
===   we want to make it support only 5MB?
KERNBASE
=== Q What value should this constant be changed to?
0xF8000000
=== Q Assume the computer has the maximum amount of memory supported
===   by the (unmodified) kernel. What's the overhead of managing this
===   memory in terms of (physical) memory spent?
===   Specify only data structures which size depends on the amount of
===   physical memory and exclude the "fixed" overhead. For example,
===   if data structure size is 123K+0.01*(memory size) and maximum 
===   amount of memory is 100MB, specify 0.01*100MB = 1024KB.
===   For each such data structure specify:
===    - size in KB (without "KB suffix")
===    - name of kernel data structure (when appropriate, in quotes)
===    - general name (free form, up to 10 words in quotes)
===    Sort the table by the size in ascending order. Please
===    align columns into readable table using spaces.
===    Format example (all the values are made up; omit the header):
===    SIZE  DATA-STRUCTURE         NAME/DESCRIPTION
===    42    "struct Segdesc gdt[]" "Global descriptor table"
256 "pte_t table[]"				"page_tables"
512 "struct PageInfo pages[]"	"page info linked list"

=== Q What challenge(s) have you chosen to implement? (specify
===   challenge numbers separated by spaces, if more than one)
2
=== Q If the challenge requires changing the kernel source, list the
===   files which you have changed/added during implementation.
===   (one file per line, relative to lab directory containing .git/)
kern/monitor.c

=== Q Describe your solution.

we added 3 commands.
For the "showmappings" and "permmappings" commands, in order to find the va-2-pa mapping we did the 
page walk using the method: pgdir_walk, and than either change permission in the pte, or received 
the correct frame address in order to print its content.
1) showmappings. Format: [showmapping <address_start> <address_end>].
   Go over each page in range (including last address round up to PGSIZE) and print
   mapping to physical address + WU flags. Example:
   showmappings 0xEFFFF000 0xf0000000:
		VA:0xeffff000 PA:0x00118000 WS
		VA:0xf0000000 PA:0x00000000 WS
2) permmappings. Format: [permmappings <va> <set/clear/flip> <u/w>]
   arg2 is set, clear or flip. arg3 is u or w.
   We do the page walk to get pte entry and set flags accordingly.
3) dumpmem. Format: [dumpmem <start_address> <end_address> <v/p>]
   Writing 16 byte per line starting with start_address ending in end_address (including).
   specify v/p for virtual or physical.
   Arguments don't have to alligned.
   Example: "dumpmem 1 14 p"
   Result: "0x00000001:  0x53f000ff  0xc3f000ff  0x53f000e2  0x00ff".
   If the address were virtual, we just printed their content, and if they were physical, we first converted
   it to physical space.
   In order to print unalligned addressed, we use memcpy into an integer variable.
   If total size was not alligned to 4, we printed any leftover as another single number.
